this is a file idk
this is a game engine ig and it has some games built in and some recorder.
(the recorder WAS built 90% by cursor ai though.. yeah... but the minigames weren't built by ai much if at all. I built them.)
there's a semi-working pong game, a one key mania game, and a 4 key mania game.
there's a very basic terminal built-in also, accessed with '/', then typing and pressing enter.
Escape and enter both go out of the terminal, but escape keeps what you typed, and enter clears what you typed and does whatever it's supposed to if you typed a valid command.
some of the commands:
    "pong": opens pong.
    "v1k": opens one key mania.
    "fnf": opens 4 key mania. this is a misnomer.
    "reopen": reopens the base game.
    "quit" or "exit": quits the game.
    "reopen " + ...: reopens the game but with an input of whatever was after "reopen ". some things that do something are:
        "mania"
        "v1k"
        "fnf" this is also a misnomer. i haven't built actual fnf, not yet at least.

yeah.
